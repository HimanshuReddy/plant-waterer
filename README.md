# plant-waterer
An automated system to monitor and water a plant

This system uses a raspberry pi to control the hardware. The pi can read input from a few sensors, gathering information about the temperature, humidity, and soil
moisture levels of an area. It also controls a motor that waters the plant. The hardware was programmed via node.js.

The pi also hosts a webpage that serves as a dashboard that can display current and historical sensor data. The webpage was written in React while also using the 
Material UI component library.
